# Calculator
Calculator using ReactJS.

Create a calculator using React.js that lets users do simple math like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. It should have buttons for numbers, math operations, and a way to clear everything. When users click buttons, the calculator should show what they're typing and give the answer when they hit "=".
